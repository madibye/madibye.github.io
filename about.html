        <li class="about-me-text">Hi, my name is Madi :) I'm 24 years of age and go by she/her pronouns.</li>
        <li class="about-me-text">I'm currently volunteering as a developer and Moderation Team leadership at Corporate
          Clash. I'm one of the main up-keepers of Clashbot!</li>
        <li class="about-me-text">I have several years of experience in Python and Java, and specifically about 1 1/2
          year's worth of experience developing Discord bots, which, in addition to pretty in-depth knowledge about
          Discord.py, involves use of database software like MongoDB and Redis. Also occasionally work on developing
          for a small MMORPG in Python using the Panda3D game engine.</li>
        <li class="about-me-text">Additionally, I have a bit of experience with JavaScript, and am currently trying to
          teach myself HTML and CSS. This website is something of an outlet for that, and I hope to work on improving
          it as often as I can.</li>
        <li class="about-me-text">Some likes of mine: Pokemon, Nintendo games in general (most of the time), the Yakuza
          series, working on Discord bots, any sort of slice of life / romcom / "cute" anime, the colors pink and
          purple, cute stuff in general c:</li>
